    <hr>
    <p>The original monuments of this 11th-century temple were
         built around a moat. It included gopura, the main temple,
          its massive tower, inscriptions, frescoes, and sculptures 
          predominantly related to Shaivism, but also of Vaishnavism 
          and Shaktism. The temple was damaged in its history and 
          some artwork is now missing. Additional mandapam and
           monuments were added in the centuries that followed.
            The temple now stands amidst fortified walls that were 
            added after the 16th century
